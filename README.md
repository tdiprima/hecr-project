## Health Equity and Climate Research Project

The project is a website/platform focused on:

- Promoting research on health equity, which involves disparities in healthcare access and outcomes based on factors like race, geography, and income.
- Exploring climate medicine, including how climate change impacts human health (e.g., through heat waves, pollution, and shifts in disease patterns).
- Connecting researchers, faculty, and scholars by making profiles, publications, and projects searchable.
- Facilitating collaboration through a user-friendly interface with filtering and search features.

Overall, it serves as a matchmaker and knowledge hub for individuals working on climate-related and equity-focused research.
